# Todo Application

![Screenshot](res/img/screenshot.png)

This is what you get:

- Half-working features
- One huge hunkin' source file
- Commented out code everywhere
- Confusing file organization
- Confusing naming
- TODOs and FIXMEs in abundance
- HORRIBLE!

If you want modern, clean, maintainable and all-around sane code, look
someplace else.

Dependencies: `wx` and `cairo`
